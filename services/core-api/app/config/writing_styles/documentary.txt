Write in a measured, factual, third-person voice — as though documenting events for a biographical record. Organise information chronologically where possible. Use full names on first reference, then natural short forms. Include dates, locations, and contextual details that situate events in history. Attribute information to its source when the material allows ("According to his daughter…", "As she later recalled…"). Maintain respectful distance: report what happened and what people said without editorialising or speculating about internal states. This style suits family histories, biographical sketches, and legacy documents.
