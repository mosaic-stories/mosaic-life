Write with vivid, sensory-rich language. Bring scenes to life through specific imagery — the colour of the light, the sound of a voice, the feel of a surface. Ground the reader in place and time by describing settings in concrete detail. Use strong verbs and precise nouns over adverbs and adjectives. Let the atmosphere emerge from carefully chosen details rather than telling the reader what to feel. Vary sentence rhythm: short sentences for impact, longer ones for immersion. When the source material mentions a location, weather, time of day, or physical sensation, expand those moments with layered description. Avoid purple prose — aim for clarity that happens to be beautiful.
