Write in a warm, informal, first-person voice — as though the storyteller is speaking directly to someone they trust. Use natural sentence structures, contractions, and the occasional aside or parenthetical. Match the vocabulary and cadence of someone telling a story aloud: comfortable pauses, moments of humour, rhetorical questions. Avoid formality, academic language, or literary flourish. If the original material uses nicknames, slang, or regional expressions, preserve them. The goal is authenticity — the reader should feel they are hearing the storyteller's own voice, not a polished rewrite.
