Write with emotional depth and resonance. Focus on the internal experience — what people felt, what moments meant, how relationships shaped the events described. Surface the emotional arc of the story: build tension, sit with difficult feelings, and allow moments of joy or tenderness to land. Use the characters' own words and reactions to reveal emotion rather than labelling feelings directly. Pay attention to the significance people attach to small gestures, traditions, and turning points. When the source material hints at something unspoken, honour that subtlety. Let the reader feel the weight of what is remembered and why it matters.
