Write with economy and precision. Every sentence should earn its place. Strip away filler, redundancy, and throat-clearing. Prefer short, direct sentences that carry impact. Choose the single best word over a cluster of approximate ones. Let silences and white space do work — not everything needs to be spelled out. This style suits stories meant to be read aloud, shared in a eulogy, or displayed alongside a photograph. Aim for the density of poetry without the obscurity: clear, distilled, and memorable.
