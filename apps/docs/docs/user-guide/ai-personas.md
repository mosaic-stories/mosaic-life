# AI Personas & Smart Connections

When you have a conversation about your loved one, Mosaic Life's AI personas draw on everything you've shared to provide meaningful, connected responses. Each persona brings a different perspective to your memories, and the system automatically discovers connections between stories, people, places, and events.

## Meet the Personas

| Persona | Focus | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **The Biographer** | Life Story Curator | Organizing memories into themes and timelines, identifying gaps in the narrative, connecting stories across life chapters |
| **The Friend** | Empathetic Listener | Emotional support during the memorial process, reflecting feelings, celebrating joyful memories alongside difficult ones |
| **The Colleague** | Professional Companion | Exploring career milestones, work relationships, mentorship stories, and professional impact |
| **The Family Member** | Family Historian | Family bonds and traditions, generational connections, holidays and gatherings, family roles |

Each persona uses the same underlying stories and memories, but approaches them from a different angle. Try switching personas to discover new dimensions of the stories you've shared.

## How Smart Connections Work

As you share stories, the system automatically identifies people, places, events, and meaningful objects mentioned in each memory. These are connected together behind the scenes, creating a web of relationships between your stories. When you mention Uncle Jim's trip to Chicago, the system can surface related stories about other family trips, other memories involving Uncle Jim, or even stories from other family members that took place in Chicago.

This means your conversations become richer over time. The more stories you share, the more connections the system can discover and suggest.

## What to Expect

- **Related stories in conversations** — When you're discussing a topic, the persona may reference other stories that connect to what you're talking about.
- **Exploration suggestions** — Personas may gently suggest directions to explore, like "There's another story about that same summer — would you like to talk about it?"
- **Cross-family connections** — If multiple family members have stories that intersect (same places, events, or people), the system can surface those connections.
- **Richer story evolution** — When you start a new conversation to expand on an existing story, the opening message reflects connections to related stories.

## Tips for Better Conversations

- **Share specific details** — Names, places, dates, and events help the system make stronger connections between stories.
- **Mention relationships** — Saying "my mother's brother Jim" gives the system more to work with than just "Jim."
- **Try different personas** — The Biographer might help you organize a timeline, while The Friend helps you process the emotions around the same memory.
- **Build on existing stories** — Use the story evolution feature to expand on stories you've already shared. The system will bring in relevant connections automatically.
- **Don't worry about order** — Share memories as they come to you. The system connects them regardless of when you share them.
