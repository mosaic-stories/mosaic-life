# Mosaic Life - Comprehensive Project Plan

## Project Overview

Mosaic Life is an open-source application designed to preserve, organize, and interact with memories and stories of loved ones. The platform enables families to capture stories through multiple input methods, browse and organize these memories, and interact with AI-powered personas based on the collected stories.

## Core Vision

Create a digital legacy preservation system that:
- Captures authentic stories and memories from family and friends
- Preserves the essence and personality of individuals through AI personas
- Provides a lasting, interactive legacy that grows over time
- Offers both self-hosted and managed hosting options
- Maintains strict privacy controls and data ownership

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Databases**: 
  - PostgreSQL (primary relational data)
  - Neo4J (relationship graphs, social connections)
- **AI Integration**: LiteLLM proxy (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, Bedrock)
- **Authentication**: Authentik/Cognito (via OIDC)
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik with SSL

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (modern, component-based)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first, responsive)
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast development)

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Development**: Local development with hot reloading
- **Deployment**: Self-hosted or cloud provider agnostic
- **Storage**: Local filesystem or S3-compatible storage

## Database Schema Design

3. **System Prompt Generation**: Create comprehensive persona description
4. **Response Filtering**: Ensure responses align with known personality
5. **Continuous Learning**: Update persona as new stories are added

### Privacy-Aware AI
```python
# Pseudo-code for AI interaction
def generate_response(user_id, message, legacy_id):
    # Get user's accessible stories
    accessible_stories = get_user_accessible_stories(user_id, legacy_id)
    
    # Generate persona from all stories (for personality)
    full_persona = generate_persona(get_all_stories(legacy_id))
    
    # Use MCP agent to query only accessible stories for examples
    relevant_memories = mcp_agent.query(accessible_stories, message)
    
    # Generate response using full persona but accessible examples only
    return ai_model.generate(
        system_prompt=full_persona,
        context=relevant_memories,
        user_message=message
    )
```
