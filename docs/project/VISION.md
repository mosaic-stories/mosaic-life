# Mosaic Life: Discovering the Full Mosaic of a Life Through Shared Stories

## The Spark

My mother was many people to many people. To her Tae Kwon Do students at the YMCA, she tought beside her husband, both black belts who taught over 10,000 community members across 27 years. To fitness enthusiasts, she was the high-impact aerobics instructor who never let them give up. To major corporations like Blue Cross, UNFI, and Raytheon, she was a visionary Health and Wellness director. To her four brothers, she was the sister who kept everyone connected. To us, she was Mom - along with being a devoted wife, caretaker to her 93-year-old mother, and everyone's "favorite human."

When cancer took her from us in just nine days, stories poured in from every corner of her life. Each person held a piece of her story that we'd never heard. A student whose life she changed. A colleague she mentored through a crisis. A friend who saw a side of her we never knew existed.

**These stories were scattered across funeral guest books, Facebook posts, text messages, and fading memories. Without action, they would disappear forever.**

## The Problem

Current solutions for preserving life stories fall short:
- **Centralized platforms** hold your memories hostage - what happens when they change their terms, raise prices, or shut down?
- **Traditional methods** (scrapbooks, videos) capture single perspectives, missing the rich tapestry of how one person touched many lives
- **Social media** scatters stories across platforms, buried in feeds, impossible to gather or preserve
- **Memory fades** - without prompting, we forget the details that make stories come alive

## The Solution: Mosaic Life

Mosaic Life is an open-source, federated platform that helps communities discover and preserve the complete story of a person's life through the eyes of everyone they touched.

### Core Principles

**üîç Discovery First**  
The magic happens when stories connect - when your mother's Tae Kwon Do student shares a memory that explains why she always said "find your balance" at home. When coworkers' stories reveal the leader you never saw. When childhood friends fill in gaps in family lore.

**üîí Your Stories, Your Control**  
- Run your own instance on your hardware
- Join a trusted community instance
- Connect across instances only when you choose
- Retract your contributions anytime
- Export everything, always

**ü§ñ AI as Memory Partner**  
Thoughtful AI assistants that:
- Interview contributors like the best oral historians
- Notice connections between stories
- Ask about details in uploaded photos
- Help create evolving biographies
- Respect the sensitivity of grief and memory

**üåê Federated by Design**  
Like email, no single company controls Mosaic Life:
- Communities run instances aligned with their values
- Privacy-focused instances for the security conscious
- Feature-rich instances for those wanting AI personas
- Cultural/religious instances with appropriate customs
- Professional instances for organizational histories

## Why This Matters

Every person is a universe of stories. Most of those stories die with them or fade in the memories of those left behind. Mosaic Life ensures that:

- **Nothing is lost** - Stories are preserved in a format that will outlive any company
- **Everything connects** - Discover the full person through all their relationships
- **Everyone contributes** - From tech-savvy relatives to elderly community members
- **Communities shape their experience** - Each instance reflects its members' values

## The Vision

Imagine a world where:
- A grandchild discovers their grandmother's activism through stories from fellow protesters
- Researchers preserve cultural histories through community-managed instances
- Companies maintain institutional memory through stories of key figures
- Families facing dementia capture memories while they still can
- Future generations understand their ancestors as complete, complex humans

## Join the Movement

Mosaic Life isn't just software - it's a protocol for how humanity preserves its stories. We're building this in the open because:
- The best ideas come from communities using the tool
- Privacy and security require transparent code
- No one company should own how we remember
- Together, we can build something that lasts generations
